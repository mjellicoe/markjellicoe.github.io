This research aims to examine the utility of goals, and cognitions about goals in a pragmatic way. In doing so we aim to determine whether goals can be used as an access route to increase self-efficacy reports.","tags":["Goal Setting"],"title":"Goal-Setting","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536447600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536447600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["AM Forsythe","M Jellicoe"],"categories":null,"content":"#\n","date":1519084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519084800,"objectID":"62ad929312636dd1aa5a63280c9bacd0","permalink":"/publication/predict-gainful-learning-go-approach/","publishdate":"2018-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/predict-gainful-learning-go-approach/","section":"publication","summary":"We present data that may not only provide direction to those who are interested in developing a measure of learning gain, but also provide a route for those wishing to directly enhance student performance through gainful learning. Richardson found that student performance showed moderate correlations with only three self-regulatory variables academic self-efficacy, grade goal and effort regulation. We examine how student self-regulatory behaviours and predict these predict feedback engagement and behavioural change. Data provide converging evidence suggesting that mastery approach goal orientations, challenging interventions from feedback, and motivational intentions are essential personal constructs linked to behavioural change. These tentative findings support the suggestion that measures of gainful learning could be operationalised as ‘self-reported behaviours that suggest the productive acquisition of beneficial skills, knowledge and attitudes through study and experience’. Evidence is also offered indicating that more research is necessary to understand the measurement of mindset.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting gainful learning in Higher Education; a goal-orientation approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Jellicoe","Dr Alexandra Forsythe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"829b76d08aad145ad8f36b47f0d24555","permalink":"/talk/hea_stem/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/hea_stem/","section":"talk","summary":"Undergraduates prize high quality formative feedback but often lack the repertoire of self-regulatory motivations and skills to grasp incremental gains in learning (Winstone et. al, 2017, 2016;Hattie, 2012). We aim to demonstrate a recent research connected learning programme designed to assist students to embed messages from feedback. This approach aimed to engage undergraduates as agents in learning by endorsing and understanding a series of measures and subsequently setting goals centred on embedding feedback. Supporting lectures and virtual tutorials were provided to embed a critical understanding of the perspectives employed. Finally, students critically assessed their understanding of relevant theories and reflected on their own use of these approaches. This approach extends the tools that can be used and evidence base to support students as deterministic agents in making valuable learning gains that extend beyond the academic arena in to employment.","tags":[],"title":"HEA STEM Conference","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic is a framework to help you create a beautiful website quickly.
